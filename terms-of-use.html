                    <p class="pb-4">This non-disclosure agreement (the ‘Agreement’) is ongoing and made between the client (the ‘Disclosing Party’) and Denglisch Docs (the ‘Receiving Party’), collectively referred to as the ‘Parties,’ for the purpose of preventing any
                        unauthorised disclosure of ‘Confidential Information’ as defined below.</p>
                    <p class="pb-md-5 pb-4">The Receiving Party understands that the Disclosing Party has disclosed or may disclose information relating to its industry and/or subject matter, which is hereinafter referred to as Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.</p>
                    <p class="pb-5">For all purposes of this Agreement, the term ‘Confidential Information’ shall collectively refer to all information or material disclosed or provided by the Disclosing Party, either orally or in writing, to the Receiving Party, including
                        any information or material that has or could have commercial value in the business in which the Disclosing Party is engaged and pertains to tangible and intangible goods or services including intellectual property and trade secrets
                        as well as ongoing or planned operations.</p>
                    <p class="pb-md-5 pb-4">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information or material that (i) is or becomes generally known or available to the public at large through no negligent act or omission of either party; (ii)
                        was already in the possession of or known to the Receiving Party prior to being disclosed or provided by the Disclosing Party; (iii) is lawfully obtained, without a duty of confidentiality, from a third party that rightfully makes
                        such disclosure without breach of a duty of confidentiality or other wrongful act by the Receiving Party; (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information.</p>
                    <p class="pb-4">The Receiving Party shall carefully restrict access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to its employees, attorneys, and contractors that have a need to know such information in order for the Receiving Party to
                        exercise or perform its rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any third-party contractors given access to Confidential Information shall be required to sign a written non-disclosure agreement at least as protective as this
                        Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb-md-5 pb-4">The Receiving Party hereby agrees to hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information and shall not make any use whatsoever at any time of such Confidential
                        Information except to evaluate internally its relationship with the Disclosing Party or to process materials submitted by the Disclosing Party as agreed upon.</p>
                    <p class="pb-4">Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as any assignment of, or granting or conferring to the Receiving Party, any rights or license or otherwise, either expressly or by implication, in or to any Confidential Information
                        disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party as a result of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights in and to the Confidential Information, rights or license under any present
